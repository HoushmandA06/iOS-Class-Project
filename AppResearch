NOTE: The comments below reflect usage of Apps on an iPad 4

App 1: GarageBand
- Navigation: list style of all music projects, user can swipe up/down to scroll, and sort by name/date; to add new projects, click "+"; 
- Once you select a project, you can switch views to "producer" where you can see the aggregated tracks or "instrument" where you can see how an instrument is modified/played to create the music for the track.  Whithin both panels, there are multiple sub-menus that you can choose to customize and create a musical track.
- design tries to emulate audio mixing/multi-track production schemes; colors are used to define different instruments, input methods, etc.  
- buttons are complex and again, meant to replicate/emulate physical production tools (think turn knob, EQ, etc) to make identification simple
- tapping is confined primarily to single click selecting; tapping takes on a more creative use when using certain instruments (strings, guitar, rythem, et al), which allow for direct touch manipulation to create a note or sound (i.e. strumming a guitar)
- GB also lets you import music files from other sources (iTunes library) to create custome loops as well as the ability to publish/distribute projects via bluetooth, email, and third party apps (like soundcloud)

App 2: Twitter
- Navigation: vertically listed tabs (on left side) with a scrolling, swipeable list on the right representing the news feed or notifications
- Simple to use, twweets can be replied to, retweeted, or favorited by touching "grayed" buttons

App 3: Zillow
- Graphics heavy interface, given the GPS driven / location finding nature of the app.  Map is swipeable (all directions), and can be zoomed (pinch) and modified with user drawn boundaries
- Left-side column includes multiple search parameter and settings
- big search tab on top right, with a filter option to the right (ties to the left tab)
- views can be changed to show search results to the right of the map or in grid form.  search results, once clicked expand and take up the screen to display infor regarding the chosen property
- the app runs advert on the bottom of the screen related to a Zillow sponsored TV show

App 4: Osmos HD (game) 
- Navigation on the first page lists three primary game play modes, with secondary categories (like settings, leader board, music, etc) above in smaller / grayed formatting
- Osmos is a simple (in concept) game that relies heavily on the accelerometer
- There is emphasis on "newton" physics, momentum, gravity, to effect movement of the main character in the game (the Mote); the Mote moves by tapping; with every tap, the Mote loses mass, but gains velocity
- Most games are won by "becoming the largest", i.e. absorbing all other elements (computer or user driven players)
- There is also a heavy use of ambient / "starscape" music to accentuate gameplay/feel

App 5: Pinterest
- Photo driven, swipeable lists, with comment and favorite buttons
- Simple to use

App 6: Yelp
- 

App 7: Zite

App 8: RedStamp (wife suggestion)
